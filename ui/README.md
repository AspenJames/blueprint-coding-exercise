# Part II

## The exercise
See the main coding exercise [Readme](../Readme.md) for a full description.

Build a user interface on top of the diagnostic screener endpoint created in Part I.

## My approach
I'm going to be using [`create-react-app`][cra] along with [tailwindcss][tw] to
bootstrap a frontend web interface. Tailwind CSS is a flexible, "utility-first"
framework that builds to quite a small size in production, making it a perfect
pair for the lightweight API built in Part I.
